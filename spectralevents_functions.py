    '''
    SPECTRALEVENTS_FIND Algorithm for finding and calculating spectral 
      events on a trial-by-trial basis of of a single subject/session. Uses 
      one of three methods before further analyzing and organizing event 
      features:
    
      1) (Primary event detection method in Shin et al. eLife 2017): Find 
          spectral events by first retrieving all local maxima in 
          un-normalized TFR using imregionalmax, then selecting suprathreshold
          peaks within the frequency band of interest. This method allows for 
          multiple, overlapping events to occur in a given suprathreshold 
          region and does not guarantee the presence of within-band, 
          suprathreshold activity in any given trial will render an event.
      2) Find spectral events by first thresholding
          entire normalize TFR (over all frequencies), then finding local 
          maxima. Discard those of lesser magnitude in each suprathreshold 
          region, respectively, s.t. only the greatest local maximum in each 
          region survives (when more than one local maxima in a region have 
          the same greatest value, their respective event timing, freq. 
          location, and boundaries at full-width half-max are calculated 
          separately and averaged). This method does not allow for overlapping
          events to occur in a given suprathreshold region and does not 
          guarantee the presence of within-band, suprathreshold activity in 
          any given trial will render an event.
      3) Find spectral events by first thresholding 
          normalized TFR in frequency band of interest, then finding local 
          maxima. Discard those of lesser magnitude in each suprathreshold region,
          respectively, s.t. only the greatest local maximum in each region
          survives (when more than one local maxima in a region have the same 
          greatest value, their respective event timing, freq. location, and 
          boundaries at full-width half-max are calculated separately and 
          averaged). This method does not allow for overlapping events to occur in
          a given suprathreshold region and ensures the presence of 
          within-band, suprathreshold activity in any given trial will render 
          an event.
    
    specEv_struct = spectralevents_find(findMethod,eventBand,thrFOM,tVec,fVec,TFR,classLabels)
    
    Inputs:
      findMethod - integer value specifying which event-finding method 
          function to run. Note that the method specifies how much overlap 
          exists between events.
      eventBand - range of frequencies ([Fmin_event Fmax_event]; Hz) over 
          which above-threshold spectral power events are classified.
      thrFOM - factors of median threshold; positive real number used to
          threshold local maxima and classify events (see Shin et al. eLife 
          2017 for discussion concerning this value).
      tVec - time vector (s) over which the time-frequency response (TFR) is 
          calcuated.
      fVec - frequency vector (Hz) over which the time-frequency response 
          (TFR) is calcuated.
      TFR - time-frequency response (TFR) (trial-frequency-time) for a
          single subject/session.
      classLabels - numeric or logical 1-row array of trial classification 
          labels; associates each trial of the given subject/session to an 
          experimental condition/outcome/state (e.g., hit or miss, detect or 
          non-detect, attend-to or attend away).
    
    Outputs:
      specEv_struct - event feature structure with three main sub-structures:
          TrialSummary (trial-level features), Events (individual event 
          characteristics), and IEI (inter-event intervals from all trials 
          and those associated with only a given class label).
